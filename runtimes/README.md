# Templates 

This folder contains all the entry point template files. 
That is code that is trasformed and injected inside functions code to make it tick.
It also contains docker file templates for both Golang and NodeJS


# Basic Testing
You can quickly test if things work ...

```bash
go build ./functions/hello
go build ./functions/ticker

```
